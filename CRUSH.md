## Code Style Guidelines

### General
- **File Naming:** Use `kebab-case` for HTML and CSS files (e.g., `index.html`, `styles.css`).

### HTML
- **Structure:** Basic HTML5 structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- **Self-closing tags:** Use self-closing tags where appropriate (e.g., `<img />`).

### CSS
- **Selectors:** Keep selectors as simple as possible. Avoid overly specific selectors.
- **Properties:** Order properties alphabetically.
- **Units:** Use `rem` or `em` for font sizes and responsive lengths; `px` for borders and small fixed elements.
- **Colors:** Use `hex` codes for colors.
